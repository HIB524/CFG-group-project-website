      <h2 class="headings">Vegan</h2>
      <p>We are proud to stand by our Vegan ethics, ensuring that everything produced in store is 100% plant based - so dairy free, egg free and most importantly cruelty free.<br> We also commit to using biodegradable packaging with plant basked inks. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col">
      <h2 class="headings">Organic</h2>
      <p>Every one of our items is made from Certified Organic ingredients, sourced as locally as possible in order to reduce food miles and support our local economy. We proudly work alongside Leadon Mills, meaning that our bread flours are produced just nine miles from the bakery.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col">
      <h2 class="headings">Fresh</h2>
      <p>Freshly baked daily on site, you can definitely taste the difference. To reduce food wastage we only produce limited amounts of certain products - though we will happily take pre-orders if you have particular favourites that you don't want to miss out on, or a party or event to cater for!</p>

  <h2>Our Story</h2>  
  <h3></h3><em>A classic tale of a lockdown pastime becoming a full change of life's direction!</em></h3>
 <p>   
Sammy had often wished that she had time to indulge her love of creative baking, but since graduating had become further and further immersed in the corporate world. Upon becoming furloughed at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, Sammy found herself with the luxury of time to kill. Upon a trip to the shops, the only flour left in stock was strong bread flour, so feeling her creativity bubble, Sammy decided to try her hand at making some preztels.... <br> 
Finding this just the therapy she needed, her passion for creating baked goods spiralled rapidly. From here, she began experimenting with bagels, breads, created her own sourdough starter for sourdough loaves and rolls, and then found herself branching into pastries too.<br>
Three years later, and Sammy has been able to step off the corporate ladder and follow her passion, with the opening of Knot & Knead, her first high street bakery, to sit alongside her successful online shop.   </p>
